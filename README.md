# PROHACK_McKinsey
Prize Place Solution for PROHACk by McKinsey

After long and extensive EDA, statistical plots and number of models testing, I decided to use only Galactic Year and target encoding features only base of galaxies. All features come from the initial dataset apart from galatic year and galaxy are useles as they have little correlation with target and have even less impact on the target. 
Optimization is done using SciPy without manual edition.
All this about lifted my model as more robust solution from 66th place in Public to 19th and I ended up with prize place.
